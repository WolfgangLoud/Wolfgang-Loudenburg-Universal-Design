      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Creative Technology & Design student, who really likes making stuff. In my free time I ski, raft, and explore the great outdoors!</p>
      <h2>About this page</h2>
      <p>This page uses media queries & responsive CSS in order to fit to a variety of different screen sizes.</p>
      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <p>In the nave above there are some of my projects that I have made both inside and outside of school. The generative art canvas was my final for Web, The volume changer was another project for that class. The Concert data page was a project for this class, and my drawing portfolio is just some art I made in my free time</p>
      <h2>Why Universal Design</h2>
      <p>The web should be accessible to all, including those with impairments and disabilities. Utilizing the principals of universal design is one of the best ways to ensure this.</p>

    <h2>A Little Poem</h2>
    <p><em>What’s sadder than being hated? 
    Probably being full of hate.
    “Insecurities are projected”,
    is what my mom used to say.</em></p>
    
    <p><em> the haters hate themselves,
    with a motive of protection
    take it out on someone else,
    turn their tongue into a weapon.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Remember it's not you it’s them,
    they are the ones enslaved.
    So try and lend a helping hand,
    disdain won’t break the chain.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Ignore the hateful things they say,
    distinguish them with love.
    It might be hard to ease their pain,
    you might just do it with a hug.</em>
