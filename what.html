            <h3 id="What?">The Basics</h3>
            <p>Universal Design focuses on creating environments, buildings, products, and services that are accessible, understandable, and usable by everyone. Transcending differences in age, ability, or disability. 
                This approach isn't a niche consideration for a minority; rather, it's a core aspect of solid design. Universal design aims to ensure that everything in our environment can be used and appreciated by all who wish to do so, recognizing the diversity of human experiences and needs. 
                It's about designing with the entire population in mind, establishing inclusivity and accessibility as fundamental design principles.</p>

            <h4>Universal Design for the Web</h4>
            <p>
                Numerous disabilities require specific adjustments in web design. These modifications often prove bennificial for almost everyone, not just for individuals with disabilities. As a result, they're frequently viewed as best practices in design overall.
                
                The key to accessible design lies in prioritizing accessibility from the beginning of your design process. While it's feasible to retrofit an existing design to accommodate users with disabilities, it's far more straightforward to factor in accessibility considerations right from the start.</p>
