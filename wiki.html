    <h2 id="section-1">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>superhero film</b> (or <b>superhero movie</b>) is a film that focuses
      on the actions of superheroes. Superheroes are individuals who possess
      superhuman abilities and are dedicated to protecting the public. These
      films typically feature action, adventure, fantasy, or science fiction
      elements. The first film of a particular character often focuses on the
      hero's origin story. The first film also frequently introduces the hero's
      nemesis. (See also: supervillain or archnemesis.)

      Many superhero films are based on superhero comics. By contrast, films
      such as the Ultraman, Kamen Rider and Super Sentai franchises, the RoboCop
      series, The Meteor Man, the Unbreakable film series, Hancock and They Call
      Me Jeeg, were made original for the screen. While The Green Hornet is
      based primarily on the original radio series and its 1960s television
      adaptation, both Underdog and The Powerpuff Girls are based on animated
      television series. Anime superhero films are based on manga and television
      shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest grossing superhero film franchises (according to the box
      office income) since 1967 are Tsuburaya Productions' Ultra Series, Toei
      Company's Kamen Rider and Super Sentai, New Line Cinema's Blade, 20th
      Century Fox's X-Men, Sony Pictures' Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam
      Raimi and the Amazing Spider-Man duology directed by Marc Webb, Pixar's
      The Incredibles, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, the Marvel
      Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). On its own,
      the superhero film has become a popular genre of film, earning over $25
      billion dollars for Marvel alone.[1][2][3]

    <h2 id="section-2">1939–1978: Early years</h2>
    <p>
      Almost immediately after superheroes rose in popularity because of comic
      books (see List of DC Comics Characters and List of Marvel Comics
      characters), they were adapted into Saturday film serials, starting with
      Mandrake the Magician (1939). Serials such as The Shadow (1940),
      Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941), Batman (1943), The Phantom (1943),
      Captain America (1944), Superman (1948) followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following decades, the decline of Saturday serials and turmoil in
      the comic book industry put an end to superhero motion pictures, with the
      exception of Superman and the Mole Men (1951), starring George Reeves,
      which was a trial balloon for the television series Adventures of
      Superman, compilations of episodes of that same series released
      theatrically, and Batman (1966) a big-screen extension of the Batman
      television series starring Adam West.[4]

      In 1957 Japan, Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the
      tokusatsu superhero character Super Giant, signaling a shift in Japanese
      popular culture towards masked superheroes in tokusatsu. Along with Astro
      Boy, the Super Giant film series greatly influenced later Japanese
      tokusatsu superhero films.[5] Moonlight Mask also became popular around
      that time, with six films retelling the story of the TV series being
      made.[6] Another early superhero film was Ōgon Bat (1966), a Japanese film
      starring Sonny Chiba based on the 1931 Kamishibai superhero Ōgon Bat.[7]
    </p>

      The kaiju monster Godzilla, originally a villain, began being portrayed as
      a superhero in the Godzilla films.[8] He has been described as "the
      original radioactive superhero" due to his nuclear origin story predating
      Spider-Man (1962 debut),[8] although Godzilla did not become a hero until
      Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964).[9] By the 1970s, Godzilla came
      to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine King of the Monsters in
      1977 describing Godzilla as "Superhero of the '70s." Godzilla was "the
      most universally popular superhero of 1977" according to Donald F.
      Glut.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1966 saw the debut of the Ultra Series with kaiju TV show Ultra
      Q. However, with the release of the original Ultraman, the franchise
      started focusing on superheroes. In 1967, Ultraman started expanding to
      films. Early films, such as Ultraman: Monster Movie Feature were
      compilations or theatrical releases of TV shows' episodes. The first
      original Ultraman film was a co-production with Thailand, The 6 Ultra
      Brothers vs. the Monster Army.[11]
    </p>
    <p>
      The popularity of television superheroes in Japan led to the start of the
      Kamen Rider and Super Sentai franchises by famous manga artist Shotaro
      Ishinomori in 1971 and 1975, respectively. Just like with Ultraman, many
      early Kamen Rider and Super Sentai episodes were released as films.
      Original Kamen Rider films released before 1978 include Kamen Rider vs.
      Shocker, Kamen Rider vs. Ambassador Hell, Kamen Rider V3 vs. Destron
      Mutants and Five Riders vs. King Dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Original superhero characters emerged in other, more comedy oriented films
      such as the French political satire film Mr. Freedom (1969), the Polish
      parody Hydrozagadka (1970) and the American B movies, Rat Pfink a Boo Boo
      (1966), and The Wild World of Batwoman (1966).[12][13]

    <h2 id="section-3">1978–1998: Rising popularity of the genre</h2>
    <p>
      Riding a wave of a new interest in fantasy and science fiction films with
      the success of Star Wars, Richard Donner's Superman (1978), the first
      major big-budget DC feature film, proved a critical and commercial
      success. The same year, Toei Company's Spider-Man reimagining and the
      first Super Sentai crossover film, JAKQ Dengekitai vs. Gorenger, were
      released. Other successful entries emerged throughout the 1980s, including
      Eight Riders vs. Galaxy King (1980), Kamen Rider Super-1: The Movie
      (1981), Richard Lester's Superman II (1981), Spider-Man: The Dragon's
      Challenge (1981) and Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop (1987). Then there was Kamen
      Rider Black: Hurry to Onigashima and Kamen Rider Black: Terrifying! The
      Phantom House of Devil Pass, both released in 1988.

    </p>
    <p>

      Comics' Captain America (1991) did not have a theatrical release and Roger
      Corman's The Fantastic Four (1994), produced solely for the legal
      maintenance of the film rights to the property[18] was released neither
      theatrically nor on home video.[15]

    <h2 id="section-4">1998–present: Massive success and box office dominance</h2>
    <p>
      In 1998, Marvel released Blade, a mix of a traditional action film as well
      a darker superhero film, with the title character having vampiric powers
      as well as carrying an arsenal of weaponry.[19] The success of Blade began
      Marvel's film success and set the stage for further comic book film
      adaptations.[27][28] Meanwhile, thanks to the popularity of Ultraman Tiga
      TV series, several films based on it and later installments were produced.
      These include Ultraman Tiga & Ultraman Dyna: Warriors of the Star of Light
      (1998), Ultraman Gaia: The Battle in Hyperspace (1999) and Ultraman Tiga:
      The Final Odyssey (2000). The Matrix (1999) also had an impact on
      superhero films. Influenced by comic books, cyberpunk fiction, Japanese
      anime, and Hong Kong action films, The Matrix effectively "reinvented" the
      superhero film, according to Adam Sternbergh of Vulture.com, crediting The
      Matrix with setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters and
      inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.[29] John
      Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television
      called the film a "revolutionary" reimagination of movie visuals, paving
      the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with
      helping to "make comic-book superheroes hip" and its bullet time effect
      effectively demonstrating the concept of "faster than a speeding bullet"
      on-screen.[30] Inspector Gadget and Mystery Men would then follow to close
      out the decade for the subgenre.

      After the comic book boom and the success of several comic book adaptation
      films (including superhero films) in the 1990s,[31] the first decade of
      the 21st century brought increased interest in superhero films and some of
      their most profitable franchises, many from Marvel Enterprises. The
      success of the X-Men TV series made 20th Century Fox licenses the film
      rights in 1994.[32] After the success of Men in Black in 1997, Columbia
      Pictures licensed the film rights of Spider-Man in 1999.[33] 20th Century
      Fox's X-Men (2000) became a film franchise by its surprise hit,[34] and M.
      Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable (2000)[35] also succeeded and added an
      element of more urban naturalism.[36] Later, one of the largest
      blockbusters of all time was released with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man
      (2002).[37] In 2004, Ultraman: The Next was released, which was a
      remaining of the original series and the franchise as a whole.[38] With
      high ticket and DVD sales, numerous new superhero films were released
      every year in the 2000s, including Faust: Love of the Damned (2000), Blade
      II (2002), Daredevil (2003), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003),
      Hulk (2003), X2: X-Men United (2003), Blade: Trinity (2004), Casshern
      (2004), Catwoman (2004), Hellboy (2004), The Punisher (2004), the
      semi-animated Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), Spider-Man 2
      (2004), Elektra (2005), Constantine (2005), Fantastic Four (2005),
      Malaysia's Cicak Man (2006), India's Krrish (2006), Thailand's Mercury Man
      (2006), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver
      Surfer (2007), Ghost Rider (2007), Chile's Mirageman (2007), Spider-Man 3
      (2007), TMNT (2007), Drona (2008) and Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008).

    <p>
      Brad Bird's The Incredibles (2004) for Pixar was a critically acclaimed
      computer-animated superhero film aimed towards families.[39] Other hybrids
      include Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006) which were fusions of superhero
      and family film, as well as My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006) a combination of
      superhero and romantic comedy.[40][41]
    </p>
    <p>
      Some series from the current and previous decades were re-released, such
      as Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (2006).[42] Other series discarded
      the continuities of previously released films and began a reboot, most
      notably Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), Louis Leterrier's The
      Incredible Hulk (2008) and Lexi Alexander's Punisher: War Zone (2008).
      Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006) stands out in that it is a sequel
      to the first two Superman films, yet also a reboot of the third and fourth
      films.[43] The Batman Begins sequel The Dark Knight (2008) received eight
      nominations at the Academy Awards with two wins for Best Sound Editing and
      Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker.

    <h2 id ="section-5">Criticism</h2>
    <p>
      As superhero film production increased during the latter end of the 2010s,
      the genre's contribution to cinema was questioned. Martin Scorsese, in an
      interview with Empire magazine, commented that "as well made as they are,
      with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme
      parks. It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional,
      psychological experiences to another human being." He stated that the
      Marvel films were not "cinema".[110] He later clarified his opinion as
      being worried about studios' overreliance, believing that in "many places
      around this country and the world, franchise films are now your primary
      choice if you want to see something on the big screen. It’s a perilous
      time in film exhibition, and there are fewer independent theaters than
      ever."[111] Criticism of Marvel Studios' films continued with Jennifer
      Aniston stating that Marvel movies are "diminishing" and believed that
      there should be a “resurgence” of “the era of Meg Ryan.” “Let’s get the
      Terms of Endearment back out there. You know, Heaven Can Wait, Young
      Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Goodbye Girl.”[112] Denis Villeneuve
      dismissed "too many Marvel films" being "a cut and paste of others"[113]
      and Roland Emmerich stating that large blockbuster films such as the MCU
      and Star Wars films were "ruining our industry a little" since "nobody
      does anything original anymore".[114] However, in March 2022, Nicolas Cage
      stated that “Marvel has done a really excellent job of entertaining the
      whole family. They put a lot of thought into it. I mean, it’s definitely
      had a big progression from when I was doing the first two ‘Ghost Rider’
      movies. Kevin Feige, or whoever is behind that machine, has found a
      masterful way of weaving the stories together and interconnecting all the
      characters. What could be wrong with wholesome entertainment that is
      appealing to the parents and the children, and gives people something to
      look forward to?” Cage asked. “I just, I don’t see what the issue
      is.”[115]
    </p>
    <p>
      Some media commentators have attributed the increased popularity of
      superhero franchises in the new millennium to the social and political
      climate in Western society since the September 11, 2001 terrorist
      attacks,[116] although others have argued advances in special effects
      technology have played a more significant role.[117] Others have
      postulated that its box office dominance is in part due to its
      flexibility, a shared trait from its original publishing origins. Namely,
      the editorial realities of comic book publishing, which can have series
      running for decades, encouraged writers to resort to a variety of story
      situations so diverse from the fantastic to the relatively realistic, for
      so long and so often that it has become an expected element of the genre
      to have such adaptability.[118] For example, with the common element being
      that they all feature heroes with extraordinary abilities and typically in
      a distinctive costume, many successful superhero films have used a
      plethora of genres such as horror (Blade), thriller (Unbreakable), period
      drama (Captain America: The First Avenger), space opera (Guardians of the
      Galaxy), family film (The Incredibles), teen film (Spider-Man:
      Homecoming), heist film (Ant-Man), fantasy (Doctor Strange), neo-noir (The
      Dark Knight), political thriller (Captain America: The Winter Soldier),
      and Western (Logan).[119]
